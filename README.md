Created an Angular, Django, and GraphQL based chatbot tailored for Old Dominion University courses. This chatbot alleviates the teaching assistants workload by answering course-related questions and meticulously assessing grades for 100+ students and dispatching emails using smtplib library, handling the SMTP protocol.
